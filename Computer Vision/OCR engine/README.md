This Project was inspired by the amazing *Abhishek Thakur*, 
The dataset used for this project is captcha images, and can be downloaded from here -
https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/CaptchaCracker/raw/master/captcha_images_v2.zip

this project uses a Transformer instead of RNN as 'decoder'.

TODO : try to use a resnet as CNN backbone, add "device" to enable GPU training.
