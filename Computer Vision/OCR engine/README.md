# OCR Engine Project
This Project was inspired by the amazing  _Abhishek Thakur_.
 The dataset used for this project is **captcha images**, and can be downloaded from here - [https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/CaptchaCracker/raw/master/captcha_images_v2.zip](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/CaptchaCracker/raw/master/captcha_images_v2.zip) . <br>
**Note:** this project uses a *Transformer* instead of *RNN* as 'decoder'.

**My Next TODO:**  try to use a resnet as CNN backbone, add "device" to enable GPU training.
